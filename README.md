Computer Vision using GPU and Transfer Learning

Categorize a set of images into ten classes from the CIFAR_10 dataset. Accomplish this by using
a fully-connected (dense) neural network and a convolutional neural network. For the convolutional neural network, images are upsampled from 32x32 to 64x64.

Average results retained roughly ~.70-.80 accuracy.
